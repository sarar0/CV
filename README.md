I am a full stack developer having graduated from <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers Academy</a> in January 2020. Before joining Makers, I had mainly worked for international not-for-profit organisations and my professional background is in Human Resources, more specifically HR policies. While in these roles I was able to develop analytical, logical thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as getting project management experience. <br>

I believe working as a software developer requires a methodical, analytical way of thinking and I see this as the perfect way of applying my technical skills and interpersonal competencies. I think this profession can be very rewarding when you are able to take full ownership of projects and see something develop from a simple idea to a full product.

<p>

- #### Analysis and logical thinking

In my last three jobs my primary responsibility was to develop, review and implement HR policies and procedures. This requires extensive research, analysis and internal/external benchmarking. Through this experience, I also acquired the ability to use a logical, structured approach when solving problems, which is a skill that I have applied and further developed during my time at Makers as well.

- #### Project management and communication

Policy reviews follow a structured project cycle, which includes set phases/milestones, internal communication plans, monitoring and reporting, as well as extensive stakeholder engagement. I learned how to work independently, set my own deadlines and priorities, while at the same time keeping communication flowing across teams and with management. 

- #### Flexibility and adaptability

I have lived, studied and worked in four different countries and this has taught me to be flexible, keep an open-mind and adapt to changing environments. Throughout my academic studies and in all my previous roles, I have always had the fortune of working in multi-cultural teams and learning from people from different backgrounds. 

- #### Language Skills

Italian (native), English (fluent), Spanish (basic), French (basic). Currently learning Turkish.

I love marine turtles and interior design. I have recently volunteered in a hospital for marine turtles and I will do this again as soon as I get the chance. Interior design is more of a hobby for me, but I have also completed a professional course and obtained a Diploma of Professional Interior Design.
