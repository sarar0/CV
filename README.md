# Sara

I am originally from Italy but I have lived in Australia and in Switzerland before moving to the UK. 
Before joining Makers, I had mainly worked for international not-for-profit organisations and my professional background is in Human Resources, more specifically HR policies. 
Why coding? I believe this is a discipline that requires a methodical, analytical way of thinking - and patience too - and that can be very rewarding when you are able to create something from start to finish and take full ownership of projects.

I love marine turtles and interior design. I have recently volunteered in a hospital for marine turtles and I will do this again as soon as I get the chance. Interior design is more of a hobby for me but I have also completed a professional course and obtained a Diploma of Professional Interior Design.
