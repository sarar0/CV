I graduated as full stack developer from <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers Academy</a> in October 2019. Before joining Makers, I had mainly worked for international not-for-profit organisations and my professional background is in Human Resources, more specifically HR policies. <br>
*Why coding?* I believe this is a discipline that requires a methodical, analytical way of thinking - and patience too - and that can be very rewarding when you are able to take full ownership of projects and create something from start to finish. 

## Skills

#### Analytical


#### Flexibility and adaptability

I am originally from Italy but I have lived and worked in Australia (for 7+ years) and in Switzerland, before moving to the UK. 

working in different countries, across teams

#### Language Skills

Italian (native), English (fluent), Spanish (basic), French (basic). Currently learning Turkish.
